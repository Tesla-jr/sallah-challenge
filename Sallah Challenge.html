            <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
            <p>posted by BGB, november 15, 2016</p>
            <p>This week i am <em>extremely</em>excited about a new cooking technique called <em> souce vide</em> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that us precisely set to the target temprature you want the food to be cooked to. in this book, <em>cooking for geeks,</em> jeff Potter describes it as "ultra-low-temprature poaching." </p>
            <p>Next month,we will be serving <strong><em>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</em></strong> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
